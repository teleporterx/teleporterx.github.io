1. Malware Type

    Virus
        Self-replicating malware that attaches itself to files or programs.
    Worm
        Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks.
    Trojan
        Disguises itself as legitimate software to deceive users.
    Ransomware
        Encrypts files and demands ransom for decryption.
    Spyware
        Gathers information about a system without the user's consent.
    Adware
        Delivers unwanted ads, often with tracking capabilities.
    Rootkit
        Stealthy malware that hides its existence and maintains privileged access.
    Botnet
        Network of compromised machines controlled remotely.
    Keylogger
        Captures keystrokes from users.
    Backdoor
        Secret access to a system, often used for persistent control.
    Fileless Malware
        Operates without needing files and hides in memory.

2. Malware Functionality

    Payload
        The part of the malware that performs the malicious activity.
    Persistence Mechanisms
        Techniques to ensure malware remains active after reboot (e.g., registry keys, services).
    Evasion Techniques
        Methods to avoid detection by antivirus and other defenses (e.g., obfuscation, polymorphism).
    Exfiltration
        Techniques used to steal and transmit data to an attacker.
    Command and Control (C&C)
        Mechanisms for remote control or data retrieval by the attacker.
    Privilege Escalation
        Gaining elevated access to perform more damaging activities.
    Denial of Service (DoS)
        Overloading a system or service to make it unavailable.

3. Target Platform

    Windows
        Specific malware designed to exploit Windows OS vulnerabilities.
    Linux
        Specific malware targeting Linux-based systems.
    MacOS
        Malware designed for Apple’s operating system.
    Android
        Mobile malware designed to compromise Android devices.
    iOS
        Mobile malware designed to compromise Apple’s iOS.
    Cross-Platform
        Malware that operates across multiple platforms.

4. Attack Delivery Mechanism

    Email Attachments
        Malware delivered through malicious email attachments.
    Social Engineering
        Malware distributed through deceptive methods to trick users (phishing, fake software).
    Exploits
        Vulnerabilities in software used to deploy malware (e.g., zero-day attacks).
    Drive-by Downloads
        Malicious downloads triggered by visiting compromised websites.
    USB Dropping
        Malware dropped on systems via infected USB drives.

5. Malware Complexity/Level

    Level 1 (Basic)
        Simple malware like keyloggers, basic Trojans, or simple payloads.
    Level 2 (Intermediate)
        Malware that employs persistence mechanisms, network communication, or minor evasion.
    Level 3 (Advanced)
        Complex malware with advanced features like sophisticated C&C, encryption, anti-debugging, or polymorphism.
    Level 4 (Highly Advanced)
        State-level malware with deep system/rootkit integration, evasion, and possibly exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities.

6. Malware Behavior

    Destructive
        Malware designed to destroy data or cripple systems (e.g., wipers, ransomware).
    Stealth
        Malware that hides its presence (e.g., rootkits, fileless malware).
    Infostealer
        Designed to steal sensitive data (e.g., banking information, personal data).
    Surveillance
        Malware used for spying, such as spyware, webcam access, or audio surveillance.

7. Malware Development Tools

    Languages
        Rust, C++, Python, Assembly, etc.
    Libraries/Frameworks
        Use of libraries like Metasploit, Empire, or custom frameworks for building tools.
    Obfuscation Tools
        Techniques/tools to hide code or functionality (e.g., UPX, obfuscators).
